      " Amidst the ongoing changes in government administration and the increasing focus on mental health, particularly on college campuses, various organizations are exploring ways to improve healthcare and research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) could face restructuring under the next Trump administration, with Dr. Jay Bhattacharya nominated as potential director. Mental health supports have become a priority for universities, such as the University of Virginia offering additional resources during election season. Board games are identified as an effective way to boost mood and reduce anxiety in adults. The plague, a deadly bacterial infection in human history, is compared to current concerns over sustainability in higher education and the need for changes to make it more resilient. International cooperation is also emphasized through a forum bringing together graduates of Soviet and Russian universities. Johns Hopkins University continues to lead in R&D funding in American colleges and universities.\n"
